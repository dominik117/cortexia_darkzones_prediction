# Notebooks

## Structure

- You can find two folders `Valeria` and `dominik`, the contents of each folders are the exploratory and testing work we did in order to arrive to the final package located at [src](../src).
- It is recomended to only use the notebooks to gain insight on how we accomplished our task, considering that the higher the notebook's number is, the most accurate it is to the final package.
- It's also recomended to only refer to [src](../src) to predict darkzones, as this is guarenteed to be the latest stable prediction model algorithm.
- If you wish to create graphs on how the prediction model performs, refer to the notebook inside the root of this folder, [model_performance.ipynb](model_performance.ipynb)
- The folder [models_for_testing](models_for_testing) contains one or more models packahed using `pickle`, you can either do a new prediction or import a previous model to see performance graphs on the [model_performance.ipynb](model_performance.ipynb) notebook.
